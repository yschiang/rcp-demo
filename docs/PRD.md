# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title: By Tool Type Sampling Strategy System

---

## 1. Objective

Enable **Metrology Engineers** to create, simulate, validate, and deploy wafer sampling strategies based on Tool Type and Process. The system should support process-specific logic and tool vendor–specific formats through a self-service interface.

---

## 2. Scope

This system covers:

- Strategy creation (via UI, Excel, or YAML)
- Simulation and preview on WaferMap
- Vendor-specific transformation and deployment
- Version control and extensibility

---

## 3. Assumptions

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| A1 | Each process is linked to tool types and tool models across vendors |
| A2 | Sampling strategies are defined by process step |
| A3 | Each tool vendor may require a different data format, requiring format-specific transformation |

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1. Strategy Creation and Management

Users can define sampling strategies through:

1. **System UI** – form-driven strategy generator  
2. **Excel Import** – rule-based bulk input  
3. **YAML Import** – for automated or structured workflows

Each strategy must include:

- Tool Type and Process Step  
- Strategy Type (e.g., center-edge, uniform grid)  
- Conditions (e.g., wafer size, product)  
- Transformations (rotation, offset, flip)

> All inputs convert to a unified `Generic Strategy Object`.

---

### FR2. Simulation and Validation

- WaferMap simulation of point layout  
- Statistics on coverage and distribution  
- Exportable point set for verification

---

### FR3. Deployment and Version Control

- Deploy to sandbox or production  
- Track version history and allow rollbacks  
- Annotate versions with notes
